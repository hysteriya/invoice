# invoice
For RapidBooks internship.

Here's a summary of the files and the overall code:

run.js: This file sets up an Express server and connects it to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It listens on port 5000 and uses the routes defined in routes.js.

routes.js: This file defines the routes for the API and maps them to the appropriate controller functions. It uses express.Router to create a router object, and then defines the routes for createaccount, createinvoice, and invoicelist.

createaccount.js: This file contains the controller function for creating a new account. It uses the accountmodel to create a new account in the MongoDB database and sends a JSON response back to the client indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

createinvoice.js: This file contains the controller function for creating a new invoice. It uses the invoicemodel to create a new invoice in the MongoDB database and sends a JSON response back to the client indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

invoicelist.js: This file contains the controller function for fetching a list of invoices. It uses the invoicemodel to query the MongoDB database for invoices that match certain criteria (account name, amount, or invoice number) and sends a JSON response back to the client with the list of invoices.

Overall, the code is an API for managing invoices and accounts. It uses Express and Mongoose to handle HTTP requests and interact with a MongoDB database. The API allows users to create new accounts and invoices, and fetch a list of invoices based on certain criteria. The code is divided into separate files to make it more modular and maintainable.
